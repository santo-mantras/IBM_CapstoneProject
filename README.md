Classification on SpaceX Data for Falcon-9 Successful landings  

[**! Disclaimer - Data belongs to respective owners/body as mentioned in Powerpoint file. This project is just for educational purpose and this account shall bear no responsibilities** ]

Overview - 
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch
This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, we will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.


Conclusion - 

In this capstone project of SpaceX, we predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 
From our data analysis and application of machine learning models we observed that Classifier models such as Logistic regression, SVM and KNN gave score of 83% accuracy which is a good score to build up the model further. 
However, 83% accuracy is still not good enough in rocket launch business where heavy amount of money is involved. Hence, We tried another model and observed that DTC (Decision Tree Classifier) model is most effective in terms of predicting whether a landing will successful or not. The model has accuracy of 94 % on test data which is most promising and helpful in making important decisions in the business.
